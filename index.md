# ePortfolio
## Introduction
_My name is Yana Burlak, I'm and SNHU student working on ePortfolio. Here I'll show case my work in several enchansmnets divided in three distict phases: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures and Databases._,

The original project that I will be improving is **PetBag Boarding and Grooming System**. It was part of IT-145 Introduction to Scripting developed in Java Programming language. 

Please follow the YouTube video link to see shortcommings of the code that was able to indentify:

## Phase 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Phase 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.
>
> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

## Phase 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

#### Header 4

*   This is an unordered list following a header.

###### Header 6

| head1        | head two          | three |

### And an ordered list:

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.

The final element.
